# Computational_Intelligence_Project
Welcome to my final project for the Computational Intelligence repository! 
## Project Discription
### 1. Flower Classification on TPU
In this part, we compared various machine learning models that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images.
* Xception model with best validation accuracy of 0.83
* DenseNet model with best validation accuracy of 0.94
* EfficientNet model with best validation accuracy of 0.95

### 2. Fourteen Celebrity Face Classification 
The small dataset contains 220 images for training and 70 images for validation. 
After data augmentation, we compared these models' results.
* ResNet model with best validation accuracy of 0.76
* DenseNet model with best validation accuracy of 0.86

### 3. Celebrity Face Classification on Mobile
The same dataset on section 2 with MobileNet model which resulted 0.76 accuracy on validation.
By using MobileNet model, the model size and number of parameters significantly decreased.
